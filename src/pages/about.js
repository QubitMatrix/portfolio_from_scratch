                <p>I'm all about tackling complex problems and a strong believer in late-night coding sessions. Fascinated by the ever-evolving realm of cybersecurity, I'm constantly learning new things that reshape my view of the digital world. In my free time I like to solve CTF problems and explore security tools.</p>
